**Me:**
As a US Navy veteran with a lifelong passion for art and tech, I hope to bring a unique perspective and skill set to the world of game development. From a young age, I have been fascinated by the power of video games to tell stories, spark imagination, and bring people together.

Through my military service and beyond, I have honed my attention to detail, and teamwork skills, which are crucial for success in the tech industry. I believe that my diverse experiences and creative mindset make me a valuable asset to any team, and I am excited to continue learning and growing in this exciting field.

Whether I am creating digital art, coding, or playing games for inspiration, I am constantly seeking new ways to push the boundaries of what is possible in the tech world. I am passionate about making meaningful and engaging experiences that bring joy and connection to people's lives.

Join me in the exciting journey of exploring the limitless possibilities of technology and unleashing our imaginations to create something truly special.
